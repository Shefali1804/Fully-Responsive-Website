            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A tiara is a jeweled head ornament. Its origins date back to ancient
                Greece and Rome. In the late 18th century, the tiara came into fashion in Europe as a prestigious piece
                of jewelry to be worn by women at formal occasions. The basic shape of the modern tiara is a
                (semi-)circle, usually made of silver, gold or platinum, and richly decorated with precious stones,
                pearls or cameos.</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tiaras are worn on the head, but also around the forehead; this depends on the model of the tiara and the fashion of the day. Wearing a tiara can lead to headaches. To make it more comfortable to wear, a large tiara is often attached to a supporting frame that is cushioned by wrapping it with velvet ribbons.
                Tiaras were extremely popular during the late 19th century and were worn at events where the dress code
                was white tie.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A flower garden or floral garden is any garden or part of a garden where
                plants that flower are grown and displayed. This normally refers mostly to herbaceous plants, rather
                than flowering woody plants, which dominate in the shrubbery and woodland garden, although both these
                types may be part of the planting in any area of the garden.</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Besides organizing the flowers in bedding-out
                schemes limited to annual and perennial flower beds, careful design also takes the labour time, and the
                color pattern of the flowers into account.
                Flower gardens are, indeed, a key factor in modern landscape design and even architecture, especially for large businesses, some of which pay to have large flower gardens torn out and replaced entirely each season, in order to keep the color patterns consistent.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A flower bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement.
                Flower bouquets can be arranged for the decor of homes or public buildings, or may be handheld. Handheld
                bouquets are classified by several different popular shapes and styles, including nosegay, crescent, and
                cascading bouquets.
                or modern styles. Symbolism may be attached to the types of flowers used, according to the culture. The
                arrangement of flowers for home or building decor has a long history throughout the world.</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Posy bouquet is typically round in shape and is thought of as modern due to the small size and relative simplicity of the arrangement. It is also popular for the ease of carrying and passing-off during the ceremony. It can be composed of an expensive flower, such as a rose, or can be a sampling of country flowers.</p>
